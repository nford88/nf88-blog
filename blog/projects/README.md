# Work Experience and Projects 
I have worked on an varied range of products so far in my software development career. Starting off in the early days I was mainly full stack based, with PHP on the backend and standard HTML/CSS/JS on the front end. 

Some of the freelance projects for clients I worked on included a time keeping invoicing service for an accountancy firm (LAMP stack) and an analytics dashboard for a local independent agency using Charts.js (FE only).

Progressing through my first permanent job, I worked with the Yii 2 PHP framework to create custom health & wellness information portals and booking systems for some of the biggest multinationals based in Ireland. This then lead me to take on a greenfield project leading the frontend development to create a newer white-label version 2.0 of that product implemented with Vue.js. Throw in bits of DevOp scripting with Python and CI/Jenkins implementation when needed, it really rounded my skills off as a software engineer.

I currently work on the front-end of a large scale government project with over 90 developers including 20 front-end developers built with Vue.js. It is a huge monolithic codebase architecture with 20+ micro-services and internally developed front-end packages. 

Outside of paid work, I like to keep myself ticking over with a few projects to learn key topics and solve problems. You can find more of these details below.
