# Minstant Messenger
Minstant Messenger is a quick an easy instant messaging application I built with Meteor framework. It allows users to send instant messages to available users, and uses the publish / subscribe model of MVC to keep message private and secure from any of users who aren't the either sender or recipent. I chose routing in the form of iron:router, MongoDB for handling the database and Bootstrap to make everything neat and responsive.

It was a simple project but taught a lot of concepts with the new protoyping framework. I could certainly see this application being scaled wider, such as an internal chat system for workplaces where employers work remotely, as apposed to commercial products such as WhatsApp or Google Hangouts. In conjunction with a wrapper such as Cordova, it also offers the ability to make this application installed on mobile devices, which complements its mobile first responsive design.
